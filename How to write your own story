You can use not visible comments by writing "//" (customizable later)
You can change text splitting format by writing `/` (customizable later) in one line, by default format style is following:
text is merged until a command or empty line is found(if you want a mergable empty line leave it with "`" [customizable later])
example:
This is a story about wolf.
It began in a long forgotten forest.

The wolf was hungry.
--------------------
would look like:
This is a story about wolf. It began in a long forgotten forest. //this line could be splitted if it doesnt fit on the screen

The wolf was hungry.
---------------------
Second formating mode checks only if a line is too long and eventually splits it, that means lines aren't merged (high resolution monitors will have less text to show and it might be annoying for someone)

Current commands:
#choice
name //can be on many lines
{
story //if you choose this choice you'll be directed inside this block
}
parameters: //here you use one or more of these parameters below[order isn't important]
#if(name>value) //choice is only avaible when all conditions in "#if" are met
#if(name>value) //choice is only avaible when all conditions in "#if" are met
#if(name>value) //choice is only avaible when all conditions in "#if" are met
#if(name>value) //choice is only avaible when all conditions in "#if" are met
#if(name>value) //choice is only avaible when all conditions in "#if" are met
#hidden no/yes //default:no if yes - it will hide choice when unavaible

#next //displays next button that allows to choose one of choices(if exist) and continue game
#end //end the story, statistics will be displayed (not currently developed)
#goto(line) //moves game to given line in textfile
#IntStatOpposite //info and params later
#IntStat //info and params later
#StringStat //info and params later
#Int //info and params later

Almost done:
#set(name, value, changemaxvalue[optional], changeminvalue[optional] ) //changes Stat with given name
#hide(name) //makes hidden Stat visible, visible becomes hidden

Planned commands (I'll add more later):
#file(filename) //switches to another file, was already done, but rewrite needs to design it again (very simple)
#showstats //displays all stats on the screen
