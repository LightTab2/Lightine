-22% of commands I'd like to create
-more, described later.

Bugged Features:
-'\t' size in bold fonts (rather very low prior to fix)

Almost Done Features:

Planned Features:
-audio files processing (sounds and music)
-port to other systems: Mac, Linux and Android(this one can take a while)
-inventory system
-multiplayer(I have an idea that seems promising)
-the ability to allow changing positions and/or size of certain objects in game's menu(hard to implant and not necessary, extremely low prior)
